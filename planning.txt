DESCRIPTION:
Diving Tracker & Information app which will featured a browsable catalog of global dive sites to add to your curated list of Visited sites, as well as a Bucket List of sites you wish to visit. Users can add their own dive sites if not visible in the seeded data.

PROCESS & PLANNING:
Build out user facing components
Authenticate users/login/signup/logout
UseContext to pass user information state allowing for filtered API responses
Ensure routes close the loop on user experience:
    Route user to all of their reviews if they post new review on existing site
    Route user to all sites posted if they post new site
    Route user to updated review upon edit/put action
Add form components and API interaction for CRUD functionality on 2 models: Review and Site
    Leverage and repurpose form component skeleton for Review Edit and Create components
